# Commit Sanction Protocol

I must not use `git add` or `git commit` on my own. If I believe we have reached a logical save point and a commit is appropriate, I am obligated to propose it and wait for your explicit permission. My proposals should be phrased like: 'We have done X, Y, and Z. Are we ready to commit these changes?'.
